# Drawing And Animate Geometric Shapes Using OpenGL and Physcis Based Simulation Algorithms
Here, I have implemented some OpenGL projects using C and OpenGL API. The problem descriptions of the projects given below:

**Problem-1. Drawing a Quad:**
Implement a function that draws a Quad called drawQuad(). Quad should be filled with the rgb color of (0.807, 0.0, 0.0)
Edges of the quad should be black.


**Problem-2. Drawing 2 Circles:**
Draw circles that have a radius of 1.0. Each circle should be filled with rgb(0.807, 0.0, 0.0), and their boundary should be black.


**Problem-3. Mouse Drag and Control:**

Implement mouse control so you can drag circles around, with the left mouse button pressed.


**Problem-4. Animating circle movement:**
Implement a game-like while loop which adjusts the positions of your circles. Each 25 milliseconds, each circle should move in a random direction. 
We suggest movement with the maximum of 0.05 in each axis. Once circles reach a certain rectangle boundary, they should be transported to the other side.
Implement a rectangular boundary of in the range of x=[-2.5,2.5] and y=[-2.5,2.5] 


**Problem-5. Implement the previous problem (problem number 4), but have 50 circles moving around:**
Initial locations of circles should be random. We suggest you enlarge the boundary. 


**Problem-6. Avoidance Force-based Crowd Simulation (Distance Focused).**


**Problem-7. Calculating Frames Per Second:**
With the crowd simulation you implemented in step 6, calculate the number of frames per second. The number of frames per second should be displayed on the screen and not flicker.
